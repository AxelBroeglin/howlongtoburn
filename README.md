## Usage
User searches for the food of their choice. The app dynamically shows them 10 results (found with the Nutritionix API) each time they press a key. Then user searches for the activity, still with an autocompletion search box (through the JSON file this time). A list is shown as before, and the user can chose the actity. After choosing their weight, the calculation is done and the app shows Howlongtoburn.

## Project Status
Project is: _finished_.

## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- The API can return results which sometimes are a bit cranky, to assure more stable and predictable results, a paid API would be better.
